This program is a way to interprety data obtained using the CHIRP in both 2024 and 2017. It can calculate sediment difference at each latitude and longitude 
in the past 7 years, accounting for water level changes. It can then generate a map displaying the difference, indicating differnt depth differences by 
different colors.
